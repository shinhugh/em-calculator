# Expectation-Maximization Calculator (WIP)

Feed the program data and it will learn on its own about the subjects involved.
The project is still a work-in-progress.

### Data

The data contains input from many people on different topics. For example, 200 people can respond to whether they like, dislike, don't care for, or don't know 50 celebrities. As a result, there are 200 x 50 inputs.

### Goal

The program will take data and, given that person X has not given a definite response to a specific topic (i.e. responded "don't know" to "Avicii"), determine the most likely response person X would make to that same topic. The program learns from the inputs made by all others as well as the other inputs made by person X to calculate this.
